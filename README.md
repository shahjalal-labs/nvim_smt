- 💎 **Modern plugins** powered by [`lazy.nvim`](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
- 🛠️ **Custom scripts and dev utilities** for full-stack productivity
- 🧬 Seamless terminal integration for **Tmux**, **Zsh**, and CLI power-users

---

## 🎯 Why This Setup?

- 🧩 **Modular Architecture**  
  Everything is split into small, clean, and reusable modules — tweak anything without breaking everything.

- 🔁 **Powerful Git Integration**  
  From automated pushes and clones to smart README generation — Git feels effortless.

- 🧠 **Advanced JS/TS Dev Experience**  
  Full support for JavaScript, TypeScript, React/JSX — powered by Treesitter, LSP, and custom tooling.

- 🔗 **Terminal-First Workflow**  
  Deep integration with Tmux & Zsh gives you a seamless terminal editing experience, all from within Neovim.

- 🌌 **Modern UI/UX**  
  Animated modes, pulse scrolls, glowing UI, smart panels, and statuslines that actually _look_ good.

## Key Highlights

### Core Modules (`lua/sj/core/custom`)

- **Git Automation:**  
  Scripts for automating Git tasks such as cloning repos, auto-pushing changes, generating GitHub repo descriptions, smart copy-paste, and automated README generation.

- **Custom Modes:**  
  Advanced custom modes and scroll modes that enhance Neovim’s behavior beyond defaults.

- **JS/TS Pro Setup:**  
  Dedicated files providing advanced support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and JSX development with custom tooling.

- **Terminal & Shell Integration:**  
  Modules facilitating smooth workflows with Tmux and Zsh inside Neovim, including command sending and terminal buffer management.

### Plugins (`lua/sj/plugins`)

- Well-curated set of plugins for coding productivity, UI enhancements, Git integration, language servers, syntax highlighting, code completion, and more.

- Examples include: `telescope`, `lualine`, `gitsigns`, `nvim-cmp`, `treesitter`, `noice`, `copilotChat`, `fzf-lua`, and many others.

- Plugin configs are modular, focused on clean setup and performance.

### Configuration Entrypoints

- `init.lua` initializes core settings, loads plugins, and sets up custom keymaps and modes.

- `lazy.lua` handles lazy-loading and management of plugins.

- Core options and mappings are clearly separated for easy adjustments.

## How to Use

- Clone the repository into your Neovim config directory (usually `~/.config/nvim`):

  ```bash
  git clone <this-repo-url> ~/.config/nvim
  ```

  ## 🚀 Getting Started After Installation

After cloning the config, follow these steps to get the full experience:

- 🧠 **Open Neovim**  
  Let the plugin manager [`lazy.nvim`](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) automatically install all configured plugins.

- 🛠️ **Explore Keymaps**  
  Check out custom commands and keybindings inside  
  `lua/sj/core/keymaps.lua`.

- 🧬 **Use Git Automation Scripts**  
  Navigate to `lua/sj/core/custom/Git` to leverage automation for:
  - Cloning & pushing repos
  - Generating README/descriptions
  - Smart copy-paste and more

- ⚙️ \*\*
  - Core settings → `lua/sj/core/options.lua`
  - Plugins → `lua/sj/plugins/`
  - Custom logic & modes → `lua/sj/core/custom/`
